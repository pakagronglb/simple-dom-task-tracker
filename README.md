## 💡 What’s this all about?

This project is a simple **Task Tracker** app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to help you organize your life in a few easy clicks. It’s like your personal assistant but without the hefty price tag. You can add tasks, complete them, or delete them from existence (because who needs unnecessary guilt when you miss a deadline?).

Inspired by the **[Task Tracker Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker-js)**, this app is designed to get you started with the basics of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **responsive web design**.

## 📜 Usage

1. **Start Typing** in the input field and hit the return arrow or the "Add Task" button. Voila! Your task appears in the list.
2. **Mark tasks as complete** by clicking the checkbox. Feel the satisfaction as they move to the bottom with a sleek strikethrough.
3. **Delete tasks** by smashing that delete button. No questions asked!

## 🛠️ How it Works (For the Curious Developer)
The app uses **DOM manipulation** to dynamically add, delete, and update the task list. When you add a task, it appends a new list item (`<li>`) to the task list (`<ul>`). Toggle the checkbox? That's a simple update to the class, adding or removing the `.completed` style. And deleting a task? We simply remove the parent element from the DOM.

Check out the code to see how **event listeners** are working their magic behind the scenes.
